# gzdoomsettings
Public repository for gzdoom settings and an autoexec.cfg to disable freelook, jumping, and crouching. This is with the intention of resembling [DOOM Retro](https://www.doomretro.com/) which is exclusive to windows. The settings provided are based on this [writeup](https://eev.ee/blog/2021/12/11/recommended-gzdoom-settings/).
I recommend rebinding spacebar to interact

Mac stuff:

location of gzdoom.ini
```
~/Library/Preferences
```
this is how you run gzdoom with additional arguments on mac assuming you've already placed the files in the right directories (check gzdoom.ini) 
```
/Applications/gzdoom.app/Contents/MacOS/gzdoom -iwad doomu -file SIGIL_v1_21 -file "Sigil II MP3 V1.0.WAD" -file SIGIL_SHREDS -file e1m4b -file e1m8b
```
