# gzdoomsettings
Public repository for gzdoom settings and an autoexec.cfg to disable freelook, jumping, and crouching. This is with the intention of resembling [DOOM Retro](https://www.doomretro.com/) which is exclusive to windows. The settings provided are based on this [writeup](https://eev.ee/blog/2021/12/11/recommended-gzdoom-settings/)

Mac stuff:

~/Library/Preferences <- location of gzdoom.ini (check here for path to put auto exec ie )

this is how you run gzdoom with any wad assuming you've already placed the files in the right directories (check gzdoom.ini) /Applications/gzdoom.app/Contents/MacOS/gzdoom -iwad doom -file (whatever file)
